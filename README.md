# Olympic Dataset Guided Project

Hello budding Data Scientists, let's try out a guided project which will enable you to get answers to questions using basic python and pandas. We will be using the Olympics data set. You will learn how to handle and clean the data in pandas. You will also learn to answer questions using simple operations. 

The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.
Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset, look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games   


## You will learn to apply :

- Python Basics
- Python Programming Constructs
- Data Structures
- Functions
- Object Oriented Programming in Python



## About the Olympics Dataset

You will be working on olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derived from the Wikipedia entry. An [all-time medal table for all Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) from 1896 to 2016, including Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games, and a combined total of both, is tabulated below. These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games.

## Pre-requisites
- Working knowledge of Pandas, Numpy
- Data indexing and slicing
