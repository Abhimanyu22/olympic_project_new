## Summer or Winter
Some Countries love Summer, some Winter. We think it has to do something with their Olympic performance.

For this task we will try to figure out which olympic event does a country perform better in:

Write a function q03_better_event that :
   
    a)Makes use of the dataframe created from the previous task.
    b)Creates a new column 'BetterEvent' that stores 'Summer','Winter' or 'Both' based on the comparision between the medals won  in Summer event and Winter event.
    c)Returns the updated dataframe

  
Parameters :

| parameter | dtype          | Argument Type | default value | description                   |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| variable  |pandas.DataFrame| compulsory    |               | Dataframe to be loaded        |

Returns:

| returns  | dtype            | description                                |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| variable | pandas.DataFrame | Dataframe with above operations inculcated |


Also find out which has been a better event with respect to all the performing countries.
